I am writing to express my interest in the Firmware Engineer position at Apogee Instruments. 
My experience as a firmware engineer at Bently Nevada and ongoing Computer Engineering degree from Utah State University align well with your requirements.

In my experience at Bently Nevada, I developed and integrated embedded systems as product solutions.
I also implemented performance optimizations that achieved measurable improvements in system response time. 
As team lead, I directed firmware and software architecture decisions and managed project timelines to deliver solutions on schedule.
Additionally, my coursework in Real-Time Operating Systems and Microcontrollers provides relevant theoretical foundation for embedded development.

I am particularly interested in the technical ownership and design freedom this position offers. 
My experience has given me strong ideas of the methods and technologies that can used to complete projects. 
Leading a team of engineers to deliver a complex embedded solution demonstrates my ability to drive projects to completion independently while using those ideas.

Thank you for considering my application.
